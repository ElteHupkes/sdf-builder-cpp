# Library unmaintained
I no longer maintain this library, because creating SDF from C++ this way seems cumbersome. Please have a look at my Python library instead: https://github.com/ElteHupkes/sdf-builder

# SDF Builder
SDF Builder is a utility library to programatically define SDF model files and output them as XML.
While I was generating Gazebo robots for my thesis research, I found it was cumbersome to write SDF manually. Since for my evolving robots I needed a programmatic way of generating these SDF bots using C++.

# Building
In due time there will be instructions here.

# Dependencies 
- Eigen3: `sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev`

# Eclipse C++11 support
